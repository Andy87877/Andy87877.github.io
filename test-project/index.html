      <td>Overview\r\nOur MSc Advanced Architectural Design is aimed at international designers who want to enhance their design and research skills.\r\nThis post-professional degree helps you consolidate your own identity as a designer. You'll develop your own distinctive specialisms through research-led design, with an emphasis on sophisticated representational techniques. Our aim is to help you become a leading architect in the profession.\r\nThe course offers an innovative, absorbing, research-led pathway in advanced architectural design. It can be undertaken on either 1-year or 2-year pathways.\r\n1 Year programme\r\nThis pathway focuses on the dialogue and interconnection between architecture and urban regions. Each year we select an urban region in the UK, and study it through a critical, poetic and speculative lens. Recently, we?ve been looking at Newcastle and the wider North East region, and the complicated legacy of industrialisation.\r\nA specialism of this programme is our emphasis on experimental, creative representational tools and modes to explore architectural issues. We encourage students to work in a range of media, from hand-drawing and modelling, to 3D modelling, virtual and augmented reality tools, and installation practices.\r\nOur workshop helps facilitate the programme, and each year we work to a large-scale exhibition of work on campus.\r\nThe pathway is structured with an intensive first semester, introducing you to a variety of representational techniques and tools, followed by a two-semester long ?thesis project?? in which you are able to set your own frameworks, sites and explorations for an in-depth architectural study through a range of experimental techniques.\r\n2 Year programme\r\nThis two year programme extends the first year of the programme into a deeper advanced understanding of the mutual interrelationship between architecture and urban form through integration with modules from our M.Arch programme.\r\nAfter completing two semesters alongside 1-year programme students, you?ll join an M.Arch design studio in your second year, and take additional modules intended to expand your critical and theoretical thinking around architecture.\r\nOur School?s leading academics in Architecture, Planning, and Landscape will support you. You'll also work with leading practitioners and creative practitioners who research techniques of drawing and designing.\r\nYou'll benefit from the School?s strong culture of integrating design theory and practice. Designers must be able to deliver their speculations. This architectural design course helps you to design at the highest level, and implement your designs.\r\nFor achievements of the School?s architecture and design students please read our annual Design Yearbook.\r\nThe city of Newcastle has a legacy of global design innovation from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This legacy is matched by its world-renowned culture-led regeneration in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe city boasts both elegant historic architecture and urbanism, and contemporary design. It is a stimulating place to spend time, engaging with advanced design thinking.\r\nREAD MORE\r\nPrevious\r\nNext\r\nImportant information\r\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

      <td>Overview\r\nBy pursuing research in the School of Engineering, you'll join a successful research group. Our focus is on energy. Our mission is to foster, promote and conduct research of international quality. We attract high-quality graduates and researchers and train them to international standards.\r\nThis research degree and our other energy programmes focus on topics, including:\r\nnovel geo-energy\r\npower electronics\r\ndrives and machines\r\nthe sustainable development and use of key resources\r\nWe can supervise MPhil and PhD projects in topics that relate to our main areas of research, which are:\r\nBio-energy\r\nOur research spans the whole supply chain:\r\ngrowing novel feedstocks (various biomass crops, algae etc)\r\nprocessing feedstocks in novel ways\r\nconverting feedstocks into fuels and chemical feedstocks\r\ndeveloping new engines to use the products\r\nCockle Park Farm has an innovative anaerobic digestion facility. Work at the farm will develop, integrate and exploit technologies. These will link with the generation and efficient use of renewable energy from land-based resources. This includes biomass, biofuel and agricultural residues.\r\nWe also develop novel technologies for gasification and pyrolysis. This large multidisciplinary project brings together expertise in:\r\nagronomy\r\nland use\r\nsocial science with process technologists and engineers\r\nIt is complemented by molecular studies on the biology of non-edible oilseeds as sources for production of biodiesel.\r\nNovel geo-energy\r\nNew ways of obtaining clean energy from the geosphere is a vital area of research. Particularly given current concerns over the limited remaining resources of fossil fuels.\r\nNewcastle University won a Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education award. This was for its world-renowned Hydrogeochemical Engineering Research and Outreach (HERO) programme. The Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research seeks to build on its record of excellence and place the North East at the forefront of research in:\r\nground-source heat pump systems\r\nother larger-scale sources of carbon-free geothermal energy\r\ndeveloping more responsible modes of fossil fuel use\r\nOur fossil fuel research encompasses both the use of a:\r\nnovel microbial process (recently patented by Newcastle University). This is to convert heavy oil (and, by extension, coal) to methane\r\ncoupling of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to underground coal gasification (UCG) using drilled boreholes\r\nThis hybrid technology (UCG-CCS) is well suited to early development in the North East. It still has 75% of its total coal resources in place.\r\nSustainable power\r\nWe undertake fundamental and applied research. This is in various aspects of power generation and energy systems, including:\r\nthe application of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels to engines and dual-fuel engines\r\ndomestic combined heat and power (CHP), and combined cooling, heating and power (trigeneration) systems. Both using waste vegetable oil and/or raw inedible oils\r\nbiowaste methanisation\r\nbiomass and biowaste combustion, gasification\r\nbiomass co-combustion with coal in thermal power plants\r\nCO2 capture and storage for thermal power systems\r\ntrigeneration with novel energy storage systems. This includes the storage of electrical energy, heat and cooling energy\r\nengine and power plant emissions monitoring and reduction technology\r\nnovel engine configurations such as free-piston engines and the reciprocating Joule cycle engine\r\nFuel cell and hydrogen technologies\r\nWe are recognised as world leaders in hydrogen storage research. Our work covers the entire range of fuel cell technologies, from:\r\nhigh-temperature hydrogen cells\r\nlow-temperature microbial fuel cells\r\nWe address some of the complex challenges which are slowing the uptake and impact of fuel cell technology.\r\nKey areas of research include:\r\nbiomineralisation\r\nliquid organic hydrides\r\nadsorption onto solid phase, nano-porous metallo-carbon complexes\r\nSustainable development and use of key resources\r\nOur research in this area has resulted in the development and commercialisation of novel gasifier technology. This is for hydrogen production and subsequent energy generation.\r\nWe have developed ways to produce alternative fuels. In particular, a novel biodiesel pilot plant that has attracted an Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) AspenTech Innovative Business Practice Award.\r\nMajor funding has been awarded for the development of fuel cells for commercial application. This has led to both patent activity and highly-cited research. Newcastle University is a key member of the SUPERGEN Fuel Cell Consortium.

      <td>Overview\r\nThis course is part of the Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme which trains Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs) for NHS employment.\r\nThe Department of Health's IAPT programme is an innovative approach to mental health. You'll train to become a practitioner who helps those experiencing depression and anxiety. You'll do this through the use of evidence-based psychological therapies.\r\nThe Low Intensity Psychological Therapies programme trains Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners under the NHS England talking therapies initiative. Low intensity therapy constitutes part of the national institute of clinical excellence (NICE) guidelines for the evidenced based treatment of mild to moderate common mental health problems.\r\nThe emphasis of low intensity therapy is to help patients self-manage their symptoms of depression and anxiety, using primarily cognitive and behavioural interventions. The programme will equip Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner trainees with the clinical competence to provide low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy, usually within a public or third sector healthcare setting. Typically, when qualified, Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners work in an NHS or public sector clinical setting, on band 5 and 6 (NHS or equivalent) salaries.\r\nThe programme directors are Laura Stevenson and Dr Claire Lomax.\r\nThe team lead is Karen Wilson.\r\nEnquires to: Iapt.director@ncl.ac.uk\r\nREAD MORE\r\nImportant information\r\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

      <td>Overview\r\nWe accept applications for MPhil, MD and PhD in Neuroscience in many research areas. These include:\r\nMotor systems development, plasticity and function\r\nWe conduct studies of normal and abnormal development. We also explore the plasticity of the motor system. This involves both clinical and preclinical developments. We run functional studies and computer modelling of motor system activity. We explore this throughout the neuraxis. We research the development and assessment of novel therapies for motor disorders/lesions. This includes stem cell and brain-machine interface.\r\nVisual system development, plasticity and repair\r\nWe research novel neuro-technological approaches to retinal dystrophy repair. This includes brain-machine interface and stem cells. We use in vitro approaches to look at retinal development and visual system wiring.\r\nNeural computation and network systems\r\nWe conduct experimental and theoretical studies. This is to understand how neurones throughout the brain interact. We explore how they act in localised networks to compute complex tasks.\r\nBehaviour and evolution\r\nOur research groups take evolutionary and comparative approaches to study brain behaviour. We compare brain function and behaviour. We explore this in:\r\ninsects\r\nbirds\r\nmammals\r\nWe study the ecological and evolutionary functions of their behaviour. Much of our work is at the forefront of:\r\nneuroethology\r\nbehavioural ecology\r\ncomparative cognition\r\nIt has important implications for the study and practice of animal welfare.\r\nVisual perception and human cognition\r\nWe research:\r\ncolour and depth perception - perception of natural scenes\r\npsychophysics and attention - memory\r\nword learning in children\r\nbody image dysfunction\r\nvisual social cognition and face processing\r\nadvertising and consumer behaviour.\r\nAuditory neuroscience\r\nWe conduct clinical and preclinical studies. We explore the brain mechanisms involved in the detection, discrimination and perception of sound. We look into how these mechanisms affect individuals with brain disorders. Disorders include dementia, autism and stroke.\r\nPain\r\nOur research focuses on:\r\nunderstanding mechanisms underlying pain, analgesia, and anaesthesia\r\nthe development of methods to assess pain and to reduce pain in animals and humans\r\nPsychobiology\r\nWe conduct studies in laboratory animals, healthy volunteers and patient populations. We investigate the mechanisms underlying mood, anxiety and addiction disorders and their treatment. Allied research looks at normal neuropsychology. It explores psychiatric disorders the physiology and pharmacology. Research focuses on neurotransmitter and endocrine systems implicated in psychiatric disorders.\r\nNeurotoxicology\r\nWe explore mechanisms of action of established and putative neurotoxins. This includes environmental and endogenous chemicals and naturally occurring toxins.\r\nForensic psychiatry and clinical psychology\r\nOur research covers:\r\nthe assessment, treatment and management of sex offender risk\r\ndevelopment and assessment of cognitive models\r\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment for bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxiety and developmental disorders\r\ndevelopmental disorders of perception and cognition\r\nSystems and computational neuroscience\r\nWe conduct theoretical and experimental studies.

      <td>Overview\r\nThe School of Pharmacy's focus is on multidisciplinary translational research. We produce work that is relevant to real life. We have scientists and clinicians working together on all aspects of pharmacy, from the bench to the bedside. Our research spans the fundamental understanding and concepts of:\r\npharmacology\r\npharmaceutical chemistry\r\ndrug delivery and formulation science\r\nclinical pharmacy\r\nWe offer MPhil and PhD supervision in the following research areas:\r\nDisease-Selective Medicines\r\nThe topic examines the discovery and development of new small molecule therapeutics. This considers improved disease selectivity and reduced systemic toxicities, through the use of:\r\nrational drug design and synthesis\r\nlead optimisation\r\npreclinical evaluation in cellular disease model systems.\r\nWe explore developments of cancer prodrugs with tumour-specific activation and reduced systemic toxicity. We explore novel therapies for improved treatment of infective diseases including:\r\ndengue\r\nother haemorrhagic fever viruses\r\ntuberculosis\r\nImproved Strategies for the Treatment of Chronic Pain\r\nWe explore the molecular mechanisms that generate the symptoms of chronic pain. We look at its translation to strategies for pain control, including opioid treatment.\r\nCellular Physiology\r\nInvestigating hormones to control epithelial ion channel activity and physiological action. We look at the control of sodium channel activity in the distal nephron and consequent hypo and hyper-tension.\r\nSafety Pharmacology and Discovery Toxicology\r\nDevelopment of new preclinical tools for identification of therapeutics with potential safety liabilities. We look at relevant cell models and systems for the detection of effects on the heart.\r\nPharmaceutics and Chemical Principles of Dosage Form Design\r\nPharmaceutical formulations to deliver active molecules to treat disease. We have active research on:\r\nintermolecular interactions\r\nnanoscale pharmaceutics and nanotherapeutics, including dosage form design from intermolecular interactions,\r\ndelivery of biopharmaceuticals.\r\nIn particular research focuses on:\r\ndetermining strategies for improving drug solubility\r\naltering materials properties to enable drug delivery and the production of enhanced medicines\r\nsupramolecular Pharmaceutics. In particular, inter/intramolecular interactions and kinetics\r\nfundamental and translational nanomedicines\r\nunderstanding and improving drug delivery via the subcutaneous, inhaled and intravitreal routes\r\nPharmaceutical Public Health\r\nThe role of community pharmacies as a central fulcrum to address health inequalities and behaviour change in relation to:\r\nsmoking\r\nalcohol\r\nsubstance misuse\r\nsexual health\r\nobesogenic behaviours\r\nCommunity pharmacies are the point of contact for patients in the wider primary healthcare team. We test the interactions of this relationship and potential role for pharmacies in the diagnosis of disease. We also explore improvements in public health from this relationship.\r\nRational Medicines Use\r\nThe safe and efficient use of medicines in primary and secondary care is central to the role of every pharmacist. Medicines are becoming complex and patients are being given more preventative medicine focused at improving their health. This can pose clear risks and significant potential for complications. Rationalisation of medicine usage:\r\ncrosses care boundaries\r\napplies both within primary and secondary care\r\nWe investigate prescribing habits and the mechanisms to support patients who take complex medicines for long periods.\r\nPatient Safety and Health Information Technology\r\nMedication errors can result in patient injury or death, and are preventable. These errors can occur at the stages of ordering, transcription, dispensing and administration. We conduct studies around key technological advances targeted towards intercepting these errors and improving patient safety. Our research focuses on evaluation of specific health information technology prevention strategies throughout the medication use process. We have a particular emphasis on health information technology. This includes its broader implications for medical care and policy. We also explore the different types and causes of errors that occur during the prescribing process when using electronic systems. We provide national and international recommendations for their improvement.\r\nSee our staff research profiles\r\nSee a non-exhaustive list of available PhD projects\r\nImportant information\r\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

We look at both the formal electoral process and non-electoral politics (social movements, protest groups, etc) Our research on the emergence of virtual political participation means that some of our work intersects with popular culture and political communication.\r\nPolitical ideologies and political thought\r\nFocus on the history of political thought as well as how these ideas are part of programmes for political action. Our research incorporates both historical and contemporary political thought prominent in the Western tradition as well as Asian philosophy and post-colonial thinking. This is an interdisciplinary theme, serving as a bridge between empirical political science and political theory.\r\nGlobal economic, environmental challenges and political economy of development\r\nStudy the importance of political ideas such as sustainable development and globalisation, as well as the struggle to define the core problems that society faces.\r\nThese challenges pose questions to the nature and reform of global governance, while generating tensions between the state and transnational forces in global politics and political economy.\r\nWe also focus the interaction of economic forces and principles with political power in the development of societal economics and welfare, as well as on theories of development and post-development. We cover a range of geographic areas in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia.\r\nDemocracy, the modern state and political organisations\r\nExamine?the role of interest groups, social movements, political parties, third-sector actors and charities, community organisations and postcolonial nationalism in relation to the modern state. We draw from ancient and modern political thought to understand the interpretation of democracy (including democratic rights and the foundations of democracy).\r\nPolitical economy of development\r\nFocus?on the interaction of economic forces and principles with political power in the development of societal economics and welfare, as well as on theories of development and post-development. We cover a range of geographic areas in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia.\r\nCritical geopolitics, security and migration\r\nFocus?on thinking critically about the political dynamics, consequences and discourses of historical and contemporary geopolitics. We cover both historical and contemporary questions of security?which also arise in relation to the migration-security nexus and other intersections.\r\nTheory of international relations\r\nTake an active role in the global debate on the units, actors and structures that shape the dynamics of international politics. Our research covers the political consequences of the constitution of the international as a distinct kind of relation.\r\nGovernance in Britain and wider Europe\r\nInvestigate?the dynamics driving public policy-making at national, EU and international levels. We focus on the challenges multi-level governance offers for concerns about legitimacy and accountability. This includes the changing relationship between the governing and the governed over matters of politics and policy. Our geographic scope includes the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, and the Mediterranean\r\nGlobal justice and human rights\r\nReflect on?the increasing need to tackle issues at a global rather than a state-only level. We tackle questions of justice from an issue perspective as well as surveys of nationalism, states, and various non-cosmopolitan theories of global justice.\r\nWe're committed to theoretical and methodological pluralism. We also support PhD students who want to pursue an interdisciplinary research agenda.\r\nOur academic researchers are published in top-ranked academic journals and work in close collaboration with over 3,000 non-academic partners locally and around the world.\r\nOur programme is international, with students coming from 27 countries in the last six years.\r\nWe welcome research projects devoted to politics subjects, as well as interdisciplinary work that attracts engagement from other departments and universities.\r\nREAD MORE\r\nImportant information\r\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

      <td>Overview\r\nThe focus of this iPhD is the application of phonetics and phonology in:\r\nfirst and second language acquisition\r\nsociolinguistics\r\nspeech science\r\nlanguage patterning\r\nThe Phonetics and Phonology integrated PhD has a large taught and assessed component as well as a supervised research element. The foundation is a common core of modules dealing with essential theoretical issues and research methods. You are also offered specialised modules which act as the basis for your thesis.\r\nYou'll have an individual course of study based on your needs and the sponsor's requirements.\r\nOne of the strengths of the course is that it brings together the teaching and research expertise of staff belonging to the Phonetics and Phonology Research Group. This group is composed of students and staff working in phonetics and phonology across three of our academic schools:\r\nSchool of Education, Communication, and Language Sciences (ECLS)\r\nSchool of English Literature, Language and Linguistics (SELLL)\r\nSchool of Modern Languages (SML)\r\nThis widens the pool of modules that are available. It enables you to interact with staff and students from a wide variety of backgrounds and expertise. Our particular areas of strength are in:\r\nphonetics and phonology in first/second language acquisition and bilingualism\r\nsociophonetic perspectives on speech perception and production\r\nrole of voice quality in speech processing\r\nlaboratory phonology and links between phonetics and phonology\r\nphonetic and phonological characteristics of languages and language description in segmental and suprasegmental aspects\r\nprosody and timing in the world's languages\r\nneurocognition of speech and language processing with focus on phonetics, phonology, and prosody\r\nThe cross-cutting theme within these areas that we are all interested in is the link between:\r\nperception\r\nproduction\r\nlearning\r\nOur perception research looks at the role of speakers and listeners in shaping linguistic systems and sound change.\r\nWork on production and learning covers our interest in investigating meaningful sound patterning. This includes:\r\nhow it's acquired\r\nstored\r\nproduced within a social context\r\nOur work also investigates categorical and graded aspects of speech and the role of language-specific factors in shaping these categories.\r\nREAD MORE\r\nImportant information\r\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

      <td>Overview\r\nUrban Planning is the understanding of the place-making processes that underpin places, society and the environment. It's also interdisciplinary, with professionals having an understanding of a range of topics. You'll gain an understanding of the fundamentals required for a successful career in planning or the wider built environment professions.\r\nThe Urban Planning master's is fully accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI). The Development pathway is accredited by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and offers a RICS-accredited route to gain Chartered Surveyors status.\r\nThe course is suitable if:\r\nyou are new to studying planning\r\nyou have studied planning before but in a different regulatory context\r\nLeading planning academics teach our modules.

Their world-leading research informs the teaching programme.\r\nWe teach the course on our Newcastle campus. You can study full-time over 12 months or part-time over two years.\r\nPart-time study consists of the same modules and options as the full-time programme.\r\nThis Master's in Urban Planning has five specialist pathways. Choose a pathway to suit your individual needs, background and career aspirations.\r\nThis is a social theory degree with no design content. If you're interested in a design degree, please see our Urban Design MA, PGDip.\r\nDevelopment pathway\r\nThe planning of the built environment is becoming more driven by economic rationales. This pathway will equip you with the knowledge and skills to critically engage with these. You'll be introduced to a variety of practical and theoretical skills. These provide a solid basis to build your career as a planner or surveyor.\r\nCareer pathways may include working for both public and private sectors or non-governmental organisations, such as:\r\nthe Homes and Communities Agency\r\nsocial enterprises interested in development\r\nhousebuilders and developers\r\nGlobal Development pathway\r\nThis specialism is ideal if you want to work in spatial planning within an urbanising and globalising world. The pathway bridges the gap between urban planning and international development. You'll engage in the theoretical and practical context of planning in a range of countries.\r\nThe pathway will prepare you for work as an urban planner and development professional around the world. If you are an international student, you can relate the core learning to your own country.\r\nRegeneration pathway\r\nThis pathway develops your knowledge of approaches to regeneration in Europe and North America. It covers different policy approaches, their potential and their actual impact on place, society and the environment.\r\nYou'll learn:\r\ntheories of regeneration practice\r\nalternative regeneration policy approaches (regional, urban and rural)\r\nthe historical origins and changing political and cultural contexts that have shaped urban policy\r\nthe potential and limitations of urban policy\r\nTeaching focuses on designing and delivering regeneration projects as well as developing a critical understanding of context.\r\nConservation pathway\r\nThis is for you if you?re interested in historic cities and urban conservation. It will develop your skills in conservation analysis, strategy-making and implementation. This pathway looks at conservation in the UK and internationally.\r\nIf you?re from a country with strong conservation traditions, or perhaps observing the loss of your heritage, you can explore:\r\nwhat heritage is\r\nwhat is valued and why\r\nwhat can be done to intervene on heritage's behalf\r\nYou'll explore ?the historic??city within different national contexts. You'll develop your understanding of the planning principles of conservation and heritage management.\r\nThe specialism is taught by a mixture of academic staff and conservation practitioners. It draws on the School?s conservation expertise and connections to engage you in the theoretical and practical context of heritage conservation.\r\nGreen Infrastructure and Landscape Planning pathway\r\nGreen Infrastructure (GI) is the development of solutions to address the increasing human impact on the environment. In an urbanising world, natural systems are under increasing pressure. GI development and landscape planning are important tools to respond to these pressures. These tools can enhance, restore or create landscapes with spaces and linkages for both human and natural systems.\r\nThis specialism offers a mix of teaching styles to develop a creative strategic approach to GI and landscape planning. Through real-world examples and the guidance of professionals, you'll gain an understanding of:\r\nthe legal framework of GI\r\nengagement with local communities\r\nyour own interests within the specialism\r\nImportant information\r\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.
