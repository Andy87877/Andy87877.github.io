Advanced Architectural Design MSc,https://search.ncl.ac.uk/s/redirect?collection=neu-web-courses&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncl.ac.uk%2Fpostgraduate%2Fdegrees%2F5383f%2F&auth=qNIX7%2FoYtFCkKdQsFqfPpg&profile=_default&rank=270&query=%7CstencilsCourseType%3Apostgraduate,"Overview
Our MSc Advanced Architectural Design is aimed at international designers who want to enhance their design and research skills.
This post-professional degree helps you consolidate your own identity as a designer. You'll develop your own distinctive specialisms through research-led design, with an emphasis on sophisticated representational techniques. Our aim is to help you become a leading architect in the profession.
The course offers an innovative, absorbing, research-led pathway in advanced architectural design. It can be undertaken on either 1-year or 2-year pathways.
1 Year programme
This pathway focuses on the dialogue and interconnection between architecture and urban regions. Each year we select an urban region in the UK, and study it through a critical, poetic and speculative lens. Recently, we?™ve been looking at Newcastle and the wider North East region, and the complicated legacy of industrialisation.
A specialism of this programme is our emphasis on experimental, creative representational tools and modes to explore architectural issues. We encourage students to work in a range of media, from hand-drawing and modelling, to 3D modelling, virtual and augmented reality tools, and installation practices.
Our workshop helps facilitate the programme, and each year we work to a large-scale exhibition of work on campus.
The pathway is structured with an intensive first semester, introducing you to a variety of representational techniques and tools, followed by a two-semester long ?˜thesis project?? in which you are able to set your own frameworks, sites and explorations for an in-depth architectural study through a range of experimental techniques.
2 Year programme
This two year programme extends the first year of the programme into a deeper advanced understanding of the mutual interrelationship between architecture and urban form through integration with modules from our M.Arch programme.
After completing two semesters alongside 1-year programme students, you?™ll join an M.Arch design studio in your second year, and take additional modules intended to expand your critical and theoretical thinking around architecture.
Our School?™s leading academics in Architecture, Planning, and Landscape will support you. You'll also work with leading practitioners and creative practitioners who research techniques of drawing and designing.
You'll benefit from the School?™s strong culture of integrating design theory and practice. Designers must be able to deliver their speculations. This architectural design course helps you to design at the highest level, and implement your designs.
For achievements of the School?™s architecture and design students please read our annual Design Yearbook.
The city of Newcastle has a legacy of global design innovation from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This legacy is matched by its world-renowned culture-led regeneration in the twenty-first century.
The city boasts both elegant historic architecture and urbanism, and contemporary design. It is a stimulating place to spend time, engaging with advanced design thinking.

Within Biomedicine PhD, MD and MPhil, we focus on exploring:
the mechanisms of disease
understanding how disease impacts lives
utilising new diagnostic techniques
utilising new therapeutic techniques
developing new treatments
As part of the MPhil, MD and PhD Biomedicine, you'll register with a University research institute.
You'll have a structured programme of supervision and training. This is via our Faculty of Medical Sciences Graduate School.
Areas of research
We undertake the following areas of research and offer MPhil, PhD and MD supervision in:
Applied immunobiology (including organ and haematogenous stem cell transplantation)
Newcastle hosts one of the most comprehensive organ transplant programmes in the world. This clinical expertise has developed with the applied immunobiology and transplantation research group. We are currently investigating aspects of:
the immunology of autoimmune diseases
cancer therapy
transplant rejection.
We also have themes to understand the interplay of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. This is via responses by a variety of pathways. We also look at how these are manipulated for therapeutic purposes. A further research theme focuses on primary immunodeficiency diseases.
Dermatology
There is an emphasis on the integration of clinical investigation with basic science. Our research themes include:
cell signalling in normal and diseased skin. This includes mechanotransduction and response to ultraviolet radiation
dermatopharmacology including mechanisms of psoriatic plaque resolution in response to therapy
stem cell biology and gene therapy
regulation of apoptosis/autophagy
non-melanoma skin cancer/melanoma biology and therapy
We also research the effects of UVR on the skin including mitochondrial DNA damage as a UV biomarker.
Diabetes
This area places emphasis on translational research. It links clinical- and laboratory-based science. Our key research themes include:
mechanisms of insulin action and glucose homeostasis
insulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell function
diabetic complications
stem cell therapies
genetics and epidemiology of diabetes
Diagnostic and therapeutic technologies
Our focus is on applied research and aims to underpin future clinical applications. We conduct technology-oriented and demand-driven research. This relates to health priority areas such as:
bacterial infection
chronic liver failure
cardiovascular and degenerative diseases
Our research involves internal and external collaborations. We work with leading UK and European academic and industrial groups. We aim to deploy next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic systems. These are utilised in the hospital and healthcare environment.
Kidney Disease
There are various research programmes exploring:
the genetics, immunology and physiology of kidney disease
kidney transplantation
We maintain close links between basic scientists and clinicians. They have translational programmes of work. These span from the laboratory to first-in-man and phase III clinical trials. Specific areas of interest include:
haemolytic uraemic syndrome
renal inflammation and fibrosis
the immunology of transplant rejection
tubular disease
cystic kidney disease
The liver
We have particular interests in:
primary biliary cirrhosis (epidemiology, immunobiology and genetics)
alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
fibrosis
the genetics of other autoimmune and viral liver diseases
Magnetic Resonance (MR), spectroscopy and imaging in clinical research
Novel non-invasive methodologies using magnetic resonance applied to clinical research. Our research falls into two categories:
MR physics projects involve the development and testing of new MR techniques. They make quantitative measurements of physiological properties using a safe, repeatable MR scan.
Clinical research projects involve the application of these novel biomarkers. They aid the investigation of human health and disease.
Our studies cover a broad range of topics including:
diabetes

what causes the destruction of joints (cell signalling, injury and repair)
how cells in the joints respond when losing tissue (cellular interactions)
whether we can alter the immune system and ?˜switch off??auto-immune disease. This includes targeted therapies and diagnostics
This research theme links with other local, national and international centres of excellence. It has close integration of basic and clinical researchers. It hosts the only immunotherapy centre in the UK.
Pharmacogenomics (including complex disease genetics)
Genetic approaches to the individualisation of drug therapy are a focus, including:
anticoagulants and anti-cancer drugs
the genetics of diverse non-Mendelian diseases, from diabetes to periodontal disease
We utilise a wide range of knowledge and experience. This is in both genetics and clinical sciences. We have access to high-throughput genotyping platforms.
Reproductive and vascular biology
Our scientists and clinicians use:
in situ cellular technologies
large-scale gene expression profiling.
We study the normal and pathophysiological remodelling of vascular and uteroplacental tissues. We developed a novel approach to cellular interactions. They use a unique human tissue resource. Our research themes include:
the regulation of trophoblast and uNk cells
transcriptional and post-translational features of uterine function
cardiac and vascular remodelling in pregnancy
We also have preclinical molecular biology projects in breast cancer research.
Respiratory disease
We conduct a broad range of research activities into acute and chronic lung diseases. We conduct scientific studies into disease mechanisms. There is also a particular interest in translational medicine approaches to lung disease. This means studying human lung tissue and cells. We use this to explore the potential for new treatments. Our current areas of research include:
acute lung injury - lung infections
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
fibrotic disease of the lung, both before and after lung transplantation
Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics
Our research projects address the harmful effects of chemicals. This includes prescribed drugs. We look to find ways to prevent and minimise these effects. We are attempting to measure the effects of small amounts of chemicals. This is to provide ways of giving early warning of the start of harmful effects. We also study the adverse side effects of medicines. We explore how liver disease and heart disease can develop in people who take medicines. They may be taking these for completely different medical conditions. Our current interests include:
environmental chemicals
organophosphate pesticides
warfarin
psychiatric drugs
anti-cancer drugs

Our strength in medicinal chemistry is evident through our track record of successful research. This has included the discovery of drugs that have progressed to clinic. We have core capacity in:
anti-cancer drug discovery
biomolecular imaging
computational chemistry
chemical biology
Nanoscience and Materials
Our research develops new methods to synthesise, characterise and improve our understanding of materials. We focus on materials with useful nanoscale properties.
Photonic Materials
Photonic materials refer to systems that respond to stimulation by light. These can range from single molecules to intricate architectures and molecular devices. Many systems focus on:
converting sunlight into chemical potential
the concentration of excitonic energy.
We focus on understanding fundamental principles by using spectroscopic examination.
Structure and Dynamics
Structure underpins the majority of research in chemistry, biology and materials science. The trouble is, the world is dynamic and not static. This means that understanding how structures evolve during a chemical reaction is critical. Our research relates to fundamental and applied research fields over broad time ranges.
Synthesis, Reactivity and Catalysis
This research group combines the expertise of organic and inorganic chemists. Our research aims to advance fundamental knowledge and capabilities in synthesis and reactivity. We focus on the elements s, p, d and f blocks across the periodic table. Through this study we can develop new and improved materials and catalytic processes.

Our staff and postgraduate students work in the Faculty of Medical Sciences or the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences. The Newcastle University Centre for Cancer operates right across the cancer research pathway with strengths ranging from cell biology and clinical trials to healthcare research and cancer research training, including:
understanding the biological differences between normal and malignant cells
understanding the molecular differences between normal and malignant cells
using this knowledge to develop new anti-cancer drugs
We're a major training base for the next generation of cancer researchers. Our Institute covers many areas of cancer research, including:
solid tumours and leukaemias
childhood and adult cancers
drug discovery and early phase clinical trials
Exploratory biology, target and biomarker discovery
Molecular genetic and mechanistic studies identify critical molecular changes in cancer. It identifies the relevance to disease development and progression. We use these biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention. We use a wide range of techniques, including:
contemporary genomic
bioinformatic
molecular biology
biochemical
cell biology
Studies focus on:
haematological malignancies (leukaemia and lymphoma)
paediatric solid tumours (neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma),
adult solid tumours (eg breast, ovarian, prostate, bladder and liver cancers).
Biomarker development
We exploit critical molecular defects as biomarkers to enhance:
disease detection and diagnosis
prediction of disease course
sensitivity to specific drugs
therapeutic monitoring.
We play leading roles in molecular diagnostics, biomarker assessment and therapeutic monitoring. This is for national and international clinical trials.
Drug development
The use of rational drug design helps achieve the exploitation of novel targets. It is through the use of structure-based design, in conjunction with medium-throughout screening. Target molecule synthesis and varied parallel synthesis approaches result in lead optimisation. Candidate drugs undergo evaluation in cell-free and whole-cell target-based assays.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials (Phase I/II/III) are undertaken in both adults and children. Trials have a strong hypothesis-testing translational research component. They are performed under:
national or international research networks (eg CR?“UK, Children's Cancer

Our MPhil and PhD in Chemical Engineering attract a diverse range of students. These are usually from disciplinary backgrounds such as:
statistics
maths
electrical engineering
chemistry
physics
Our research
Research in the department of Chemical Engineering is cross-disciplinary. Our strategy centres on investigating novel processes, materials, and concepts that can deliver transformational routes for a sustainable and circular economic framework.
We work in a range of sectors that include:
biomedics
food
water
waste
energy
We investigate solutions for relevant health, environmental and material problems.
Advanced materials
Every article, instrument, machine or device we use depends on its success upon:
materials
design
effective production
We work on a wide range of materials topics including:
new material development
optimising of materials processing
testing and evaluation at component scale and at high spatial resolution
modelling
failure analysis
Much of our work relates to materials and processes for:
renewable energy generation
energy efficiency
carbon capture
storage
We also use biological and bio-inspired processes to develop new functional materials.
Process intensification
Process intensification is the philosophy that processes can often be made smaller, more efficient and safer using new process technologies and techniques, resulting in order of magnitude reductions in the size of process equipment. This leads to substantial capital cost savings and often a reduction in running costs.

By pursuing research in the School of Engineering, you'll join a successful research group. Our focus is on energy. Our mission is to foster, promote and conduct research of international quality. We attract high-quality graduates and researchers and train them to international standards.
This research degree and our other energy programmes focus on topics, including:
novel geo-energy
power electronics
drives and machines
the sustainable development and use of key resources
We can supervise MPhil and PhD projects in topics that relate to our main areas of research, which are:
Bio-energy
Our research spans the whole supply chain:
growing novel feedstocks (various biomass crops, algae etc)
processing feedstocks in novel ways
converting feedstocks into fuels and chemical feedstocks
developing new engines to use the products
Cockle Park Farm has an innovative anaerobic digestion facility. Work at the farm will develop, integrate and exploit technologies. These will link with the generation and efficient use of renewable energy from land-based resources. This includes biomass, biofuel and agricultural residues.
We also develop novel technologies for gasification and pyrolysis. This large multidisciplinary project brings together expertise in:
agronomy
land use
social science with process technologists and engineers
It is complemented by molecular studies on the biology of non-edible oilseeds as sources for production of biodiesel.
Novel geo-energy
New ways of obtaining clean energy from the geosphere is a vital area of research. Particularly given current concerns over the limited remaining resources of fossil fuels.
Newcastle University won a Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education award. This was for its world-renowned Hydrogeochemical Engineering Research and Outreach (HERO) programme. The Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research seeks to build on its record of excellence and place the North East at the forefront of research in:
ground-source heat pump systems
other larger-scale sources of carbon-free geothermal energy
developing more responsible modes of fossil fuel use
Our fossil fuel research encompasses both the use of a:
novel microbial process (recently patented by Newcastle University). This is to convert heavy oil (and, by extension, coal) to methane
coupling of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to underground coal gasification (UCG) using drilled boreholes
This hybrid technology (UCG-CCS) is well suited to early development in the North East. It still has 75% of its total coal resources in place.
Sustainable power
We undertake fundamental and applied research. This is in various aspects of power generation and energy systems, including:
the application of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels to engines and dual-fuel engines
domestic combined heat and power (CHP), and combined cooling, heating and power (trigeneration) systems. Both using waste vegetable oil and/or raw inedible oils
biowaste methanisation
biomass and biowaste combustion, gasification
biomass co-combustion with coal in thermal power plants
CO2 capture and storage for thermal power systems
trigeneration with novel energy storage systems. This includes the storage of electrical energy, heat and cooling energy
engine and power plant emissions monitoring and reduction technology
novel engine configurations such as free-piston engines and the reciprocating Joule cycle engine
Fuel cell and hydrogen technologies
We are recognised as world leaders in hydrogen storage research. Our work covers the entire range of fuel cell technologies, from:
high-temperature hydrogen cells
low-temperature microbial fuel cells
We address some of the complex challenges which are slowing the uptake and impact of fuel cell technology.
Key areas of research include:
biomineralisation
liquid organic hydrides
adsorption onto solid phase, nano-porous metallo-carbon complexes
Sustainable development and use of key resources
Our research in this area has resulted in the development and commercialisation of novel gasifier technology. This is for hydrogen production and subsequent energy generation.
We have developed ways to produce alternative fuels. In particular, a novel biodiesel pilot plant that has attracted an Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) AspenTech Innovative Business Practice Award.
Major funding has been awarded for the development of fuel cells for commercial application. This has led to both patent activity and highly-cited research. Newcastle University is a key member of the SUPERGEN Fuel Cell Consortium. Significant developments have been made in:
fuel cell modelling
membrane technology
anode development
catalyst and fuel cell performance improvements

Pulp and periapical disease, including post-treatment disease and the complications of dentoalveolar trauma present a significant disease burden worldwide. Train with Newcastle University to gain specialist skills for endodontic clinical practice, and to engage in endodontic education, research and scholarship.
Our suite of MClinDent programmes has a common foundation of Restorative Dentistry. We have created three bespoke options to enable dentists to acquire specialist skills and knowledge in the fields of:
prosthodontics
endodontics
periodontics
All three elements will be studied in stage 1 of the MClinDent and will remain a common theme in stages 2 and 3 as you continue in your speciality of Endodontics.
Find out more in our?School of Dental Sciences postgraduate taught programmes brochure.
The MClinDent programmes are designed to align with the General Dental Council?™s UK curricula for specialist training in Endodontics, Periodontics or Prosthodontics and can prepare students to sit the Membership examinations at the UK Royal Colleges.
You should then be able to use the clinical and academic portfolio of evidence that you have built to demonstrate equivalence to the GDC?™s curriculum in either Periodontics, Endodontics or Prosthodontics in relation to specialist listing. The information about specialist listing in the UK is held by the GDC. Find out more.
It is important to note that successful completion of one of these programmes does not guarantee acceptance by Royal College to sit their examinations or registration as a specialist through the GDC in the UK.

genomics
molecular biology
biochemistry
physiology
Our research provides evidence for the underlying molecular and physiological processes that affect animal behaviour and physiology.
Our research is driven by the desire to develop new biological systems that address health, food, energy and water security. The applied nature of our work has led to the launch of successful spin-out companies, such as Geneius. These companies offer graduate employment opportunities and make a substantial contribution to the local economy. The commercial applications that result from our research range from natural products discovery and creation of novel antimicrobials and biopesticides to sustainable methods of reducing food spoilage.
Applied and environmental biology research is based in the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences.

This is to give you the requisite GBC with the BPS.
This route is for those students who do not have a first degree in psychology providing GBC with the BPS. Their degree must cover research methods and statistics relevant to psychology. For example, a joint or combined degree that includes psychology or an international psychology degree that does not confer GBC with the BPS).

Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology (IN) forms the core of a unified care service for patients with kidney disease. It is vital in providing rapid diagnoses and treatment for patients presenting to renal units.
Diagnostic and interventional procedures are often undertaken exclusively by radiologists, vascular surgeons, or transplant surgeons in the UK. This can lead to fragmented service provision and prolonged procedural waiting times for patients.
It can also lead to inconsistent and inadequate exposure to procedural training for renal trainees.
This unique course provides comprehensive theoretical and practical interventional nephrology training.
You will experience training in all aspects of nephrology-focused point of care, including:
ultrasound
haemodialysis access management
renal biopsy
PD catheter management
This course would help trainees develop into interventional nephrologists.

This course is part of the Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme which trains Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs) for NHS employment.
The Department of Health's IAPT programme is an innovative approach to mental health. You'll train to become a practitioner who helps those experiencing depression and anxiety. You'll do this through the use of evidence-based psychological therapies.
The Low Intensity Psychological Therapies programme trains Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners under the NHS England talking therapies initiative. Low intensity therapy constitutes part of the national institute of clinical excellence (NICE) guidelines for the evidenced based treatment of mild to moderate common mental health problems.
The emphasis of low intensity therapy is to help patients self-manage their symptoms of depression and anxiety, using primarily cognitive and behavioural interventions. The programme will equip Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner trainees with the clinical competence to provide low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy, usually within a public or third sector healthcare setting. Typically, when qualified, Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners work in an NHS or public sector clinical setting, on band 5 and 6 (NHS or equivalent) salaries.
The programme directors are Laura Stevenson and Dr Claire Lomax.
The team lead is Karen Wilson.

We accept applications for MPhil, MD and PhD in Neuroscience in many research areas. These include:
Motor systems development, plasticity and function
We conduct studies of normal and abnormal development. We also explore the plasticity of the motor system. This involves both clinical and preclinical developments. We run functional studies and computer modelling of motor system activity. We explore this throughout the neuraxis. We research the development and assessment of novel therapies for motor disorders/lesions. This includes stem cell and brain-machine interface.
Visual system development, plasticity and repair
We research novel neuro-technological approaches to retinal dystrophy repair. This includes brain-machine interface and stem cells. We use in vitro approaches to look at retinal development and visual system wiring.
Neural computation and network systems
We conduct experimental and theoretical studies. This is to understand how neurones throughout the brain interact. We explore how they act in localised networks to compute complex tasks.
Behaviour and evolution
Our research groups take evolutionary and comparative approaches to study brain behaviour. We compare brain function and behaviour. We explore this in:
insects
birds
mammals
We study the ecological and evolutionary functions of their behaviour. Much of our work is at the forefront of:
neuroethology
behavioural ecology
comparative cognition
It has important implications for the study and practice of animal welfare.
Visual perception and human cognition
We research:
colour and depth perception - perception of natural scenes
psychophysics and attention - memory
word learning in children
body image dysfunction
visual social cognition and face processing
advertising and consumer behaviour.
Auditory neuroscience
We conduct clinical and preclinical studies. We explore the brain mechanisms involved in the detection, discrimination and perception of sound. We look into how these mechanisms affect individuals with brain disorders. Disorders include dementia, autism and stroke.
Pain
Our research focuses on:
understanding mechanisms underlying pain, analgesia, and anaesthesia
the development of methods to assess pain and to reduce pain in animals and humans
Psychobiology
We conduct studies in laboratory animals, healthy volunteers and patient populations. We investigate the mechanisms underlying mood, anxiety and addiction disorders and their treatment. Allied research looks at normal neuropsychology. It explores psychiatric disorders the physiology and pharmacology. Research focuses on neurotransmitter and endocrine systems implicated in psychiatric disorders.
Neurotoxicology
We explore mechanisms of action of established and putative neurotoxins. This includes environmental and endogenous chemicals and naturally occurring toxins.
Forensic psychiatry and clinical psychology
Our research covers:
the assessment, treatment and management of sex offender risk
development and assessment of cognitive models
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment for bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxiety and developmental disorders
developmental disorders of perception and cognition
Systems and computational neuroscience
We conduct theoretical and experimental studies. We aim to understand the following areas of memory:
neuroanatomy
neuropharmacology of vision
visual attention
episodic

The School of Pharmacy's focus is on multidisciplinary translational research. We produce work that is relevant to real life. We have scientists and clinicians working together on all aspects of pharmacy, from the bench to the bedside. Our research spans the fundamental understanding and concepts of:
pharmacology
pharmaceutical chemistry
drug delivery and formulation science
clinical pharmacy
We offer MPhil and PhD supervision in the following research areas:
Disease-Selective Medicines
The topic examines the discovery and development of new small molecule therapeutics. This considers improved disease selectivity and reduced systemic toxicities, through the use of:
rational drug design and synthesis
lead optimisation
preclinical evaluation in cellular disease model systems.
We explore developments of cancer prodrugs with tumour-specific activation and reduced systemic toxicity. We explore novel therapies for improved treatment of infective diseases including:
dengue
other haemorrhagic fever viruses
tuberculosis
Improved Strategies for the Treatment of Chronic Pain
We explore the molecular mechanisms that generate the symptoms of chronic pain. We look at its translation to strategies for pain control, including opioid treatment.
Cellular Physiology
Investigating hormones to control epithelial ion channel activity and physiological action. We look at the control of sodium channel activity in the distal nephron and consequent hypo and hyper-tension.
Safety Pharmacology and Discovery Toxicology
Development of new preclinical tools for identification of therapeutics with potential safety liabilities. We look at relevant cell models and systems for the detection of effects on the heart.
Pharmaceutics and Chemical Principles of Dosage Form Design
Pharmaceutical formulations to deliver active molecules to treat disease. We have active research on:
intermolecular interactions
nanoscale pharmaceutics and nanotherapeutics, including dosage form design from intermolecular interactions,
delivery of biopharmaceuticals.
In particular research focuses on:
determining strategies for improving drug solubility
altering materials properties to enable drug delivery and the production of enhanced medicines
supramolecular Pharmaceutics. In particular, inter/intramolecular interactions and kinetics
fundamental and translational nanomedicines
understanding and improving drug delivery via the subcutaneous, inhaled and intravitreal routes
Pharmaceutical Public Health
The role of community pharmacies as a central fulcrum to address health inequalities and behaviour change in relation to:
smoking
alcohol
substance misuse
sexual health
obesogenic behaviours
Community pharmacies are the point of contact for patients in the wider primary healthcare team. We test the interactions of this relationship and potential role for pharmacies in the diagnosis of disease. We also explore improvements in public health from this relationship.
Rational Medicines Use
The safe and efficient use of medicines in primary and secondary care is central to the role of every pharmacist. Medicines are becoming complex and patients are being given more preventative medicine focused at improving their health. This can pose clear risks and significant potential for complications. Rationalisation of medicine usage:
crosses care boundaries
applies both within primary and secondary care
We investigate prescribing habits and the mechanisms to support patients who take complex medicines for long periods.
Patient Safety and Health Information Technology
Medication errors can result in patient injury or death, and are preventable. These errors can occur at the stages of ordering, transcription, dispensing and administration. We conduct studies around key technological advances targeted towards intercepting these errors and improving patient safety. Our research focuses on evaluation of specific health information technology prevention strategies throughout the medication use process. We have a particular emphasis on health information technology. This includes its broader implications for medical care and policy. We also explore the different types and causes of errors that occur during the prescribing process when using electronic systems. We provide national and international recommendations for their improvement.

We have five main research themes for MPhil or PhD students.
Condensed matter and nanoscale physics
Research focus
Electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of novel solid-state materials. In particular, novel semiconductor structures and nanostructured materials such as nanocrystals and nanowires. Theoretical studies use quantum mechanical approaches and involve massively parallel supercomputing.
Our development of new approaches to quantum modelling is changing the size and complexity of systems that can be modelled. Experimental work takes place at synchrotron facilities in Europe and America. Related work takes place with colleagues in the Emerging Technology and Materials group.
Biophysics
Research focus
We explore the structure and function of cells. The aim is to create artificial life and build machines based on biological parts.
You'll need an understanding of biological physics.

We'll use techniques including:
single-molecule manipulation
atomic force microscopy
scanning tunnelling microscopy
Astrophysics
Research focus
Galaxies and the interstellar medium.
The source of the galactic magnetic field and its influence on the structure of the galaxy.
Cosmology, particularly the early universe and its origin in the big bang.
Ultrafast optics
Research focus
Coherent optical control of atomic collisions in ultracold gases by femtosecond laser light for the study of problems in fundamental physics. This includes the measurement of time dependence on the fundamental constants of nature.
We also research metrological protocols for the characterisation of broadband light. This is specifically related to the application and foundational aspects of quantum mechanics.

You will be able to take part in the Researcher Education and Development. This is an advanced and interdisciplinary research training and researcher development programme created by the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.
You'll also have the opportunity to enrol in the Postgraduate Certificate in Research Training. This provides a broader knowledge of different research methodologies. It equips you with the skills to carry out advanced research in your area of interest.
The politics of difference
Examine the issues thrown up by the social and political differences of humanity from a variety of perspectives including:
analytical and continental political philosophy
comparative politics
international politics
post-colonialism
Political Behaviour
Examine the different forms of political participation that link society to the political systems of the world. We look at both the formal electoral process and non-electoral politics (social movements, protest groups, etc) Our research on the emergence of virtual political participation means that some of our work intersects with popular culture and political communication.
Political ideologies and political thought
Focus on the history of political thought as well as how these ideas are part of programmes for political action. Our research incorporates both historical and contemporary political thought prominent in the Western tradition as well as Asian philosophy and post-colonial thinking. This is an interdisciplinary theme, serving as a bridge between empirical political science and political theory.
Global economic, environmental challenges and political economy of development
Study the importance of political ideas such as sustainable development and globalisation, as well as the struggle to define the core problems that society faces.
These challenges pose questions to the nature and reform of global governance, while generating tensions between the state and transnational forces in global politics and political economy.
We also focus the interaction of economic forces and principles with political power in the development of societal economics and welfare, as well as on theories of development and post-development. We cover a range of geographic areas in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Democracy, the modern state and political organisations
Examine?the role of interest groups, social movements, political parties, third-sector actors and charities, community organisations and postcolonial nationalism in relation to the modern state. We draw from ancient and modern political thought to understand the interpretation of democracy (including democratic rights and the foundations of democracy).
Political economy of development
Focus?on the interaction of economic forces and principles with political power in the development of societal economics and welfare, as well as on theories of development and post-development. We cover a range of geographic areas in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Critical geopolitics, security and migration
Focus?on thinking critically about the political dynamics, consequences and discourses of historical and contemporary geopolitics. We cover both historical and contemporary questions of security?which also arise in relation to the migration-security nexus and other intersections.
Theory of international relations
Take an active role in the global debate on the units, actors and structures that shape the dynamics of international politics. Our research covers the political consequences of the constitution of the international as a distinct kind of relation.
Governance in Britain and wider Europe
Investigate?the dynamics driving public policy-making at national, EU and international levels. We focus on the challenges multi-level governance offers for concerns about legitimacy and accountability. This includes the changing relationship between the governing and the governed over matters of politics and policy. Our geographic scope includes the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, and the Mediterranean
Global justice and human rights
Reflect on?the increasing need to tackle issues at a global rather than a state-only level. We tackle questions of justice from an issue perspective as well as surveys of nationalism, states, and various non-cosmopolitan theories of global justice.
We're committed to theoretical and methodological pluralism. We also support PhD students who want to pursue an interdisciplinary research agenda.
Our academic researchers are published in top-ranked academic journals and work in close collaboration with over 3,000 non-academic partners locally and around the world.
Our programme is international, with students coming from 27 countries in the last six years.
We welcome research projects devoted to politics subjects, as well as interdisciplinary work that attracts engagement from other departments and universities.

The focus of this iPhD is the application of phonetics and phonology in:
first and second language acquisition
sociolinguistics
speech science
language patterning
The Phonetics and Phonology integrated PhD has a large taught and assessed component as well as a supervised research element. The foundation is a common core of modules dealing with essential theoretical issues and research methods. You are also offered specialised modules which act as the basis for your thesis.
You'll have an individual course of study based on your needs and the sponsor's requirements.
One of the strengths of the course is that it brings together the teaching and research expertise of staff belonging to the Phonetics and Phonology Research Group. This group is composed of students and staff working in phonetics and phonology across three of our academic schools:
School of Education, Communication, and Language Sciences (ECLS)
School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics (SELLL)
School of Modern Languages (SML)
This widens the pool of modules that are available. It enables you to interact with staff and students from a wide variety of backgrounds and expertise. Our particular areas of strength are in:
phonetics and phonology in first/second language acquisition and bilingualism
sociophonetic perspectives on speech perception and production
role of voice quality in speech processing
laboratory phonology and links between phonetics and phonology
phonetic and phonological characteristics of languages and language description in segmental and suprasegmental aspects
prosody and timing in the world's languages
neurocognition of speech and language processing with focus on phonetics, phonology, and prosody
The cross-cutting theme within these areas that we are all interested in is the link between:
perception
production
learning
Our perception research looks at the role of speakers and listeners in shaping linguistic systems and sound change.
Work on production and learning covers our interest in investigating meaningful sound patterning. This includes:
how it's acquired
stored
produced within a social context
Our work also investigates categorical and graded aspects of speech and the role of language-specific factors in shaping these categories.

The information about specialist listing in the UK is held by the GDC.?Find out more.

Urban Planning MSc,https://search.ncl.ac.uk/s/redirect?collection=neu-web-courses&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncl.ac.uk%2Fpostgraduate%2Fdegrees%2F5373f%2F&auth=tPEWodLPZgH3e9wCsSYMHg&profile=_default&rank=102&query=%7CstencilsCourseType%3Apostgraduate,"Overview
Urban Planning is the understanding of the place-making processes that underpin places, society and the environment. It's also interdisciplinary, with professionals having an understanding of a range of topics. You'll gain an understanding of the fundamentals required for a successful career in planning or the wider built environment professions.
The Urban Planning master's is fully accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI). The Development pathway is accredited by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and offers a RICS-accredited route to gain Chartered Surveyors status.
The course is suitable if:
you are new to studying planning
you have studied planning before but in a different regulatory context
Leading planning academics teach our modules. They are members of planning teaching staff in the School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape. Their world-leading research informs the teaching programme.
We teach the course on our Newcastle campus. You can study full-time over 12 months or part-time over two years.
Part-time study consists of the same modules and options as the full-time programme.
This Master's in Urban Planning has five specialist pathways. Choose a pathway to suit your individual needs, background and career aspirations.
This is a social theory degree with no design content. If you're interested in a design degree, please see our Urban Design MA, PGDip.
Development pathway
The planning of the built environment is becoming more driven by economic rationales. This pathway will equip you with the knowledge and skills to critically engage with these. You'll be introduced to a variety of practical and theoretical skills. These provide a solid basis to build your career as a planner or surveyor.
Career pathways may include working for both public and private sectors or non-governmental organisations, such as:
the Homes and Communities Agency
social enterprises interested in development
housebuilders and developers
Global Development pathway
This specialism is ideal if you want to work in spatial planning within an urbanising and globalising world. The pathway bridges the gap between urban planning and international development. You'll engage in the theoretical and practical context of planning in a range of countries.
The pathway will prepare you for work as an urban planner and development professional around the world. If you are an international student, you can relate the core learning to your own country.
Regeneration pathway
This pathway develops your knowledge of approaches to regeneration in Europe and North America. It covers different policy approaches, their potential and their actual impact on place, society and the environment.
You'll learn:
theories of regeneration practice
alternative regeneration policy approaches (regional, urban and rural)
the historical origins and changing political and cultural contexts that have shaped urban policy
the potential and limitations of urban policy
Teaching focuses on designing and delivering regeneration projects as well as developing a critical understanding of context.
Conservation pathway
This is for you if you?™re interested in historic cities and urban conservation. It will develop your skills in conservation analysis, strategy-making and implementation. This pathway looks at conservation in the UK and internationally.
If you?™re from a country with strong conservation traditions, or perhaps observing the loss of your heritage, you can explore:
what heritage is
what is valued and why
what can be done to intervene on heritage's behalf
You'll explore ?˜the historic??city within different national contexts. You'll develop your understanding of the planning principles of conservation and heritage management.
The specialism is taught by a mixture of academic staff and conservation practitioners. It draws on the School?™s conservation expertise and connections to engage you in the theoretical and practical context of heritage conservation.
Green Infrastructure and Landscape Planning pathway
Green Infrastructure (GI) is the development of solutions to address the increasing human impact on the environment. In an urbanising world, natural systems are under increasing pressure. GI development and landscape planning are important tools to respond to these pressures. These tools can enhance, restore or create landscapes with spaces and linkages for both human and natural systems.
This specialism offers a mix of teaching styles to develop a creative strategic approach to GI and landscape planning. Through real-world examples and the guidance of professionals, you'll gain an understanding of:
the legal framework of GI
engagement with local communities
your own interests within the specialism
